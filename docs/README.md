# Why?

I wanted to create a webpage from Markdown with minimal effort, just through a script tag at the top of a page, and write pure Markdown & it should work right out of the box. There are plenty of alternatives, and for most situations, using something like Jekyll or server-side Markdown will give a more consistent result, but setting this up takes some time/skill.

# Use cases
- For people who are not "tech savy" but can write markdown. No learning hurdle, just add one line at the top of the page.
- If you don't have server access
- Minimal effort to get decent looking text on the web
- Creating semi secure (hidden by long url) pages, such as http://oscarmorrison.com/md-page/oimasdoijasdmadeupurl-0123123#stuff-to-show-you

# Workflow
1. Create a github repo
2. Add a `gh-pages` branch
3. Drag and drop pages created using `md-pages`

# How?
Just create a blank file `whatever.html` and add the script tag (current version `<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/oscarmorrison/md-page/c72eb9e9/md-page.js"></script><noscript>
`) to the top of the page, then write markdown

# What markdown?
It uses GitHub flavour markdown https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

# How does that work?
It's pretty basic, all the custom code lives here https://github.com/oscarmorrison/md-page/blob/master/script.js, but mainly it just adds some style, then uses the incredible https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown to convert text from markdown to HTML and replaces that in the DOM (this is included in the `md-page.js` file)

# Does it do anything else?
Yep. I have added a couple of extra convenience features (mainly for my use case)

## Default title
You can manually set a title using the `<title>` tag. Otherwise, it will use the first dom element (e.g., a header if you start with a header)

## Open external urls externally
It modifies any link, and checks it again with the current host; if it's a different link, or not relative, it will add a `target="_blank"` to the link. All other links with the same hostname, or starting with `/`, `./`, `#` will not open in a new window.

## Add underline to markdown
Not sure why GitHub doesn't have this, but it's nice `___underline___`

## Styles
This adds some basic styles to the header. Mainly it just changes the font family, and the minimal amount of styles for each of the markdown features

## Deeplink to ids
Added a bit of code to be able to deep link to ids in page headers e.g., http://oscarmorrison.com/md-page/#tables
